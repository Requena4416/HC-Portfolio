                <p>Jazmaine Reque√±a is a first year at Miami Dade College Honors College where she is in 
                    pursuit of earning her Associate of Arts in Computer Information Systems. She decided 
                    to establish a career in Information Technology after watching her father fix multiple
                    computer hardware and software systems. To aid her in her career journey, she enrolled 
                    in the IT Academy in her high school where she had the opportunity to intern with Raytheon 
                    Technologies. During that internship, she learned leadership and communication skills 
                    necessary in an IT work environment. One way Jazmaine put those skills into use was when 
                    she was invited to the CIO Conference as a previous scholarship recipient and a guest 
                    speaker, along with other scholarship recipients, discussing how the scholarship has helped 
                    in her college endeavors. Jazmaine has also been accepted to be a research intern at 
                    California State University during the summer semester of her freshman year of college. 
                    There, she will be learning about data analytics and machine learning which can hopefully 
                    advance her college experience. In her free time, Jazmaine enjoys listening to music and 
                    baking treats for her family. <br><br>
                    To contact her, please use her school email: Jazmaine.requena001@mymdc.net.
